##Examples

###Load package

```{r}
# library(devtools)
# install_github("piecewiseSEM", "jslefche")
library(piecewiseSEM)
```

###Load data from Shipley 2009

```{r}
data(shipley2009)
```
The data is alternately hosted in Ecological Archives E090-028-S1 (DOI: 10.1890/08-1034.1).

###Create model set

The model corresponds to the following hypothesis (Fig. 2, Shipley 2009);

![Shipley 2009 Fig. 2](http://www.esajournals.org/na101/home/literatum/publisher/esa/journals/content/ecol/2009/00129658-90.2/08-1034.1/production/images/large/i0012-9658-90-2-363-f02.jpeg)

Models are constructed using a mix of the `nlme` and `lmerTest` packages, as in the supplements of Shipley 2009. 

```{r}
# Load required libraries
library(lmerTest)
library(nlme)

# Create list of models 
shipley2009.modlist = list(
  lme(DD~lat, random = ~1|site/tree, na.action = na.omit, 
  data = shipley2009),
  lme(Date~DD, random = ~1|site/tree, na.action = na.omit, 
  data = shipley2009),
  lme(Growth~Date, random = ~1|site/tree, na.action = na.omit, 
  data = shipley2009),
  glmer(Live~Growth+(1|site)+(1|tree), 
  family=binomial(link = "logit"), data = shipley2009) )
```


###Run Shipley tests

`get.sem.fit` returns a list of the following:
(1) the missing paths, whether these paths are conditional on any other variables in the model, and associated p-values;
(2) the Fisher's C statistic and p-value for the model (derived from a Chi-squared distribution);
(3) the AIC, AICc (corrected for small sample size), and associated d.f. for the model.

The argument `add.vars` allows you to specify a vector of additional variables whose causal independence you also wish to test. This is useful if you are comparing nested models. Default is `NULL`.

The argument `adjust.p` allows you to adjust the p-values returned by the function based on the the total d.f. for the model (see supplementary material, Shipley 2013). Default is `FALSE` (uses the d.f. reported in the summary table).

(See ["p-values and all that"](https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-help/2006-May/094765.html) for a discussion of p-values from mixed models using the `lmer` package.)

```{r}
get.sem.fit(shipley2009.modlist, shipley2009)
```

The missing paths output differs from Table 2 in Shipley 2009. However, running each d-sep model by hand yields the same answers as this function, leading me to believe that updates to the `lme4` and `nlme` packages are the cause of the discrepancy. Qualitatively, the interpretations are the same.

###Extract path coefficients

Path coefficients can be either unstandardized or standardized (in units of standard deviation of the mean). Default is `FALSE`. The function returns a `data.frame` sorted by increasing p-value.

```{r}
get.sem.coefs(shipley2009.modlist, shipley2009)
```

###Generate variance-covariance SEM using `lavaan`

Generate variance-covariance based SEM from the list of linear mixed models. The resulting object can be treated like any other model object constructed using the package `lavaan`.

```{r}
library(lavaan)
lavaan.model = get.lavaan.sem(shipley2009.modlist, shipley2009)
summary(lavaan.model)
```
The output shows that the variance-covariance SEM is a worse fit, indicating that a hierarchical piecewise approach is justified.
